# Hi!

Hi I'm **Freyyj** (or Freyja, or Frey, or Frey·ja as you like) part-time girl and part-time writer on technology, culture, and the internet.

You can find me online at [**freyyj.org**](https://freyyj.org) and on Twitter at [**@freyyj**](https://twitter.com/freyyj).

I write as often as I can make myself do it. Here's my latest.

( 🖥️ = technology, 🌏 = social platforms, 🎞️ = culture, 💄 = boy-to-girl stuff, 📓 = personal, 🗞️ = other )

* 💄  [**Out**](https://freyyj.org/out-2021) <sub><em>September 19, 2021</em></sub>

    I need to get out more.

* 💄  [**Long Jacket**](https://freyyj.org/long-jacket) <sub><em>January 24, 2021</em></sub>

    &hellip; and not even a short skirt anymore. Two stupid leggings stories from the holidays, and how to make leggings work for you.

* 📓  [**Reflecting on 2020**](https://freyyj.org/2020-reflecting) <sub><em>December 27, 2020</em></sub>

    Thoughts on a year spent WFH, largely in isolation, and working on websites and photoshoots.

* 🎞️  [**How Not to Wear Bodysuits in 2077**](https://freyyj.org/2077) <sub><em>December 26, 2020</em></sub>

    The internet is angry. Again.

* 🎞️  [**The Original Uniform**](https://freyyj.org/star-trek-uniform) <sub><em>October 31, 2020</em></sub>

    An ode to the incredibly cute women&rsquo;s uniforms in <em>Star Trek</em>&rsquo;s original series, which coincidentally, is also my Halloween costume this year.

A full list of [my articles is here](https://freyyj.org/articles).
